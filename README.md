# FriendPatches

A plugin which fixes the 'Unknown' player name issue on servers that allow late-joins. It also implements the 'Recently played with' feature of Steam so that you can see who you recently played with in your Steam interface, this can be helpful if the ingame 'Open profile' button doesn't work for some reason (which happens sometime).

## Issues
Report any issues on [Github](https://github.com/Lauriichan/FriendPatches) (preferred) or my [Discord](https://discord.gg/vjqAufuy)

## Notice
- Should have no problems with mods that allow more players than the original game does.
- You can disable the 'Recently played with' feature in the config of the plugin.
